# Silver Spring Justice Coalition Database Website

This repo contains the code for a HTML and CSS website that uses JavaScript for frontend event handling and function creation. JavaScript was also used to create a backend that connects to our PostgresSQL database server and delivers data to and recieves data from the frontend. The main framework that we used is Node.js, with Bulma included to make page styling easier and more consistent.

## File Structure
1. Client folder: Stores HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are used on the frontend of the website.
2. node_modules folder: Stores all modules used by the Node.js framework
3. Server folder: Stores the routes that our backend API uses to convey data.
4. READEME.me: Our readme file.
5. package_lock.json: Defines all dependencies for our app.
6. package.json: Defines topline dependencies and provides other information about our app.
7. server.js: Used to initally boot the server and define the location of our API routes and other important files.
